<strong>#Bus Travel Widget</strong>

A local worker uses the bus to travel to work everyday, they need a widget that will help them calculate how many trips they can make to travel for an amount of points entered and selected destination and travel times (peak vs off-peak). 

Create a widget that allows her to enter:

A amount of points
select where she is traveling from ( … ) - all trips are to the City Centre
select her travel time peak or off-peak
To see how many return trips she can make in peak or off-peak travel.
Only show return trip information if “Return trip” is checked.

The widget should calculate:

The cost price per trip (single)
The total  number of trips she can take
The number of return trips she can make
The cost per return trip
The price for a trip based on - travel time (peak or off-peak)
